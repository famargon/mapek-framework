# MAPEK-FRAMEWORK

The first framework written in NodeJs to implement a MAPEK Loop.

This project enable the community to create adaptative systems based on
a simple version of the MAPEK Loop.

This project was created initially with research purposes, but can be extended and 
improved with the help and support of the community.

There is a couple of example implementations to show the use of the actual api.

# Future plans

  - create a npm module
  - create a cloud service to share the configurations
  - improve the properties system
  - Implement a generic repository to enable diferent types of databases
  - add more phases to the loop(analysis,execute)
